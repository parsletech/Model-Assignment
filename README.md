This is a model that correlates the number of people who interacted with a facebook post to the actual comments the post received.
It can be used to check the efficiency of each post which gives a user important information on how to maximise views.
Linear regression was used to model the data since it is very practicla and can be understood easily.
the data was then processed and visualised using a graph.
